- View
The most fundamental component for building a UI, View is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style,
some touch handling, and accessibility controls. View maps directly to the native view equivalent
on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a UIView, <div>, android.view, etc.

View is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.


- Flat List
performant interface for rendering basic, flat lists, supporting the most handy features:

Fully cross-platform.
Optional horizontal mode.
Configurable viewability callbacks.
Header support.
Footer support.
Separator support.
Pull to Refresh.
Scroll loading.
ScrollToIndex support.
Multiple column support.
If you need section support, use <SectionList>.


- TouchableOpacity
A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it.
Opacity is controlled by wrapping the children in an Animated.View, which is added to the view hierarchy. Be aware that this can affect layout.
